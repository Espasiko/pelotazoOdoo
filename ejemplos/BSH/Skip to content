Error: Error Attempting to read Image

So, I am creating a TauriV2 + Leptos project that involves tesseract.js CDN. I can successfully upload and read the image inside the project folder but the issue is when I read an image outside the project folder, I get an error saying (Error: Error attempting to read image.")
I want to know if it is possible for tesseract.js to access images outside the project folder
The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:

Can you confirm whether you are able to access these files in another library/function (not Tesseract.js)?  If not, then I think this is a Tauri question rather than a Tesseract.js question.  Frameworks for building desktop applications such as Electron and Tauri do limit what filesystem-related features are enabled by default for security reasons.  Current best practices for accepting input files should be discussed somewhere in the documentation for those programs.
Sorry, something went wrong.

Yes, I can access these files using the tesseract library, but I opted to use a cdn because I need to use the app on mobile
Sorry, something went wrong.

It is unclear to me what this means.  Are you claiming that the browser version of Tesseract.js works if you host all of the files locally but does not work when the Tesseract.js files are hosted on a CDN?
If you want assistance, the best thing you can do is create a minimal reproducible example that can be cloned and easily run to reproduce the issue.  Without that, all we can do is guess as to what is going on.
